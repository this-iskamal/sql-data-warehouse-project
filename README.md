# ðŸ“¦ SQL Data Warehouse Project

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern SQL Data Warehouse using layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold). It showcases how raw data from different systemsâ€”such as ERP and CRMâ€”can be ingested, cleaned, transformed, and modeled into a structured format optimized for analytics.

The warehouse follows a **star schema** design at the Gold Layer, enabling efficient querying and reporting. It includes fact and dimension tables to support common business intelligence scenarios like sales analysis, customer segmentation, and performance tracking.

This project is inspired by real-world data engineering practices and highlights essential concepts such as:

- Data staging and normalization  
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using SQL  
- Data quality improvement across layers  
- Building analytical models for decision support

It serves as a practical example to learn about SQL-based data warehousing and end-to-end data pipeline development.
